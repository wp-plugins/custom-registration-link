== Description ==

= Introduction =
<p>
Custom Registration Link allows you to modify the registration link of your WordPress website.
This will result in greatly reduced spam registrations.
The default registration link is “wp-login.php?action=register” and is heavily targeted by spam-bots.
This plugin will change this link to another one and make the old one invalid.
</p>

= Reduce spam-bot registration =
<p>
User agents who will try to access the normal registration link will be redirected to a page telling them
that registration is disabled (wp-login.php?registration=disabled), in order to reduce spam registrations
and with the potential benefit that learning spam-bots will not try next time as they will “think” that your website
doesn’t accept registrations. Normal visitors will go to the new registration link.
The day I installed Custom Registration Link, all of my spam-bot registrations suddenly stopped.
</p>

= Customizable =
<p>
The new link is customizable in your WordPress dashboard,
and you are strongly advised to change the default value for something of your choice so that your website is unique.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin the ultimate spam-bot protection? =
Of course not, but it is a great additional protection against them.

= Can I put some HTML into the new link? =

No! The only valid characters are [a-zA-Z0-9_-] and in general any character valid in an URL-encoded string.

= Why isn't Custom Registration Link translated in my language? =

Most probably because nobody submitted a translation for your language yet. But you can help.
